# General Notes

- I was able to complete routes for /customers and /customers/:id
- I have not used React Testing Library before but did manage to get a couple of very basic tests written. Obviously it would have been great to add more if I had more time
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the typescript flag
